EECS 392 Project 
--------------------------

Instroduction:
TouchMore is an iOS application to send simulated key events.
TouchMoreReceiver is a macOS application to receive simulated key events.
Use TouchMore to send key event to macbook to mimic a numerical pad or some other application shortcuts.


Test Instruction:
No additional library required.
Must allow network access.

To make it work properly, TouchMore need to be simulated on a phone or another device. Otherwise, received key event will be the input of simulation program, which will be meaningless.
